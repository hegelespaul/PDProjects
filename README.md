# PDProjectsCancel changes
A repository made for sharing my Pure Data doodles. In the Tutorial folder you can see the material shared by Mike Moreno (https://github.com/MikeMorenoDSP) in his PD classes and in Mis PAtches you can see some instruments and effect created for specific porpuses, such as homeworks or music performances.
